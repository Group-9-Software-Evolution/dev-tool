# dev-tool

This is the dev-tool proposal from group 9 in the Software evolution project course 2021. 

##Prerequisites
MNE library - https://mne.tools/stable/install/index.html
Graphviz - https://graphviz.org/download/



Make sure you have the mne library installed for python3 before running the visual part. To install, just run: pip install mne 

In order to try the dev-tool out on a project, do the following steps. 
1. run: python code2flow-master/c2f ''*path to project to test*''.
2. run: python visual/nme_chord.py ''*what you want the plot to be called*''

A .png file will be saved to dev-tool/, and an interactive version may pop up as a program.
